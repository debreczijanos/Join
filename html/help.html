            Welcome to the Help Page of Join - Your Guide to Our Kanban Project Management Tool
          </p>
          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            Join is an innovative project management tool based on the Kanban methodology. It was developed by dedicated
            students as part of their education at the Developer Akademie. While Join is primarily designed for
            educational purposes, it still offers an intuitively designed platform for tracking workflows and tasks.

            It’s important to note that Join has been created mainly for learning, thus it may not be well-suited for
            extensive professional use. We strive to provide a user-friendly experience; however, we cannot guarantee
            continuous performance or complete accuracy.
          </p>


          <h2>How to use it</h2>
          <p>Here’s a brief guide on utilizing Join:</p>

          <h2>Project Overview </h2>

          <p>Upon logging in, you’ll be greeted by a default dashboard that displays your project information.</p>

          <h2>The Board</h2>

          <p>The board visualizes your project with four predefined lists: "To Do," "In Progress," "Awaiting Feedback,"
            and "Done."</p>

          <h2>Adding Cards</h2>

          <p>To create tasks, click the "+" icon under the relevant list. Fill in details such as task name,
            description, due date, and assignees.</p>

          <h2>Moving Cards</h2>

          <p>Track your tasks’ progress by simply dragging and dropping cards from one list to another.</p>

          <h2>Deleting Cards</h2>

          <p> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Please be cautious when
            deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.</p>

          <h2>Creating Contacts</h2>

          <p> To collaborate with team members, you can add contacts in the "Contacts" section. Click on "New Contact"
            and provide the necessary information. After creation, these contacts can be assigned tasks and actively
            engage in the project.

            Keep your project board consistently updated to ensure all team members are informed about the current
            status.
